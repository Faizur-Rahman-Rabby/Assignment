    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
        <h3>Here is a simple recipe for a classic beef dish, beef stroganoff:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. beef sirloin, sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>8 oz. mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li> 1/2 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. flour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. butter</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Egg noodles, cooked according to package instructions</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Instructions:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Heat the olive oil and butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the sliced beef strips and cook until browned on both sides, about 2-3 minutes per side. Remove the beef from the skillet and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add the diced onion and sliced mushrooms to the same skillet and cook until the onions are translucent and the mushrooms have released their moisture, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the flour over the vegetables and stir until everything is coated. Cook for another minute or two, until the flour is lightly browned.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the beef broth to the skillet, stirring constantly, until a thick sauce forms. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the sour cream to the skillet, stirring until well combined.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked beef strips back into the skillet and stir until everything is heated through.</li>
                <li> Serve the beef stroganoff over cooked egg noodles.</li>
            </ul>
